Mary had a little lamb, its fleece was white
as snow.
And everywhere that Mary went the lamb was sure to go.
It followed her to school one day which was against the rule.
It made the children laugh and play to see the lamb at school.
And so the teacher sent it out, but
still it lingered near.
It stood and waited round about, till Mary did appear.
“Why does the lamb love Mary so?” the little children cry.
